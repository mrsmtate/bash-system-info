**INTRO**

bash-system-info was designed as a class project. Submitted May 2024

**FILENAME NOTES**
1. script filename = bashsysinfo.sh

2. output filename = sysinfo.txt (*Output file will be created in user home directory. ~/sysinfo.txt)

**FUNCTION NOTES**
1. Script will check for existence of sysinfo.txt in user home directory and create if not found. 

2. Script will prompt the user to respond if they would like to overwrite the file data if it already exists. 

   a. If user responds no, new data will append to any previously saved output in the file. 

**USE NOTES**
1. I suggest using 'more' for reading output file in some environments, especially where scrolling is not possible.

2. Use of sudo may be required. if any operation is not permitted, rerun with appropriate permissions.
