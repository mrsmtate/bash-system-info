bash-system-info was designed as a class project. Submitted May 2024

script filename = bashsysinfo.sh

output filename = sysinfo.txt (*Output file will be created in user home directory. ~/sysinfo.txt)

Script will check for existence of sysinfo.txt in user home directory and create if not found. 

It will also prompt the user to respond if they would like to overwrite the file data if it already exists. 

  If user responds no, new data will append to any previously saved output in the file.
